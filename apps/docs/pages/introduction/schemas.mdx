# Schemas

ENS records are flexible by design — any key can store any value. But flexibility without structure creates fragmentation. When every application encodes data differently, interoperability breaks down and the ecosystem splinters into silos.

Schemas solve this by defining a shared contract for how structured data should be encoded and interpreted. A schema describes the shape of a record: its fields, their types, and how they map to on-chain or off-chain storage. Applications that resolve the same schema speak the same language, regardless of who built them.

## ENSIP Schemas

This package manages the canonical set of schemas used across the ENS ecosystem. Schemas are organized into two tiers:

- **Community schemas** (`src/schemas`) — proposed and maintained by application developers and working groups.
- **Global schemas** (`src/globals`) — a curated collection of schemas derived from ratified ENSIPs, representing the shared baseline all resolvers should support.

## Trust and Verifiability

Each schema is pinned to IPFS, then signed using EIP-712 so consumers can verify both *what* was published and *who* signed it.
