# Schemas

 The node classification metadata spec dictates how JSON schemas can be appended to an ENS name (or subname) to expose which additional metadata attributes are expected to be provided for that node. It is expected that a popular, standardized set of schemas will become widely used, which will improve cross-compatibility across the industry, however anyone is free to create additional JSON schemas to facilitate attaching whatever metadata serves their purpose best. 
 
 In the section below, you can find our collection of proposed schemas which we hope the industry will use and build upon. All of these schemas are still a work in progress, and we are open to feedback and suggestions.
 
 Our schemas are all published to IPFS to ensure immutability and availability for the long term. They also include an EIP-712 signature to provide proof of authorship.

## Schema Categories

Each schema is named for the `class` of node it is expected to be used with. We have also included a `globals` schema which includes text records defined by other ENSIPs.
