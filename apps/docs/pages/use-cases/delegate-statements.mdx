# Delegate Statements

## The Problem

Delegates in a DAO governance system often publish a statement — a
summary of their philosophy and why others should delegate voting power
to them. Because many delegates participate in multiple DAOs, their
statement often varies from one community to the next.

Right now, every governance platform — Agora, Tally, Karma — stores
delegate statements independently. Delegates update their statement in
one place and it doesn't propagate anywhere else. There is no on-chain
source of truth.

## Our Solution

The ENS Organizational Registry allows delegates to publish statements
directly on their ENS name, with a unique version scoped to each DAO
they are active in — using the DAO's ENS name as the parameter.

```
delegate.alice.eth
  └── statement[uniswap.eth] = "I prioritise..."   # Uniswap statement
  └── statement[ens.eth]    = "My focus is..."     # ENS statement
  └── statement             = "I am a delegate..."  # default fallback
```

Because ENS records are public and permissionlessly readable, any
governance tool can resolve the statement without a proprietary API or
platform-specific submission flow. One update propagates everywhere.

## Discovering delegates

For DAOs with permissionless delegation systems, delegates can be
discovered automatically:

1. Look at on-chain token balances to generate a list of accounts that
   have been delegated to.
2. For each account, perform a reverse ENS lookup to find their
   associated ENS name.
3. Check whether they have a `statement[your-dao.eth]` record set.
4. If found, surface their statement directly — no manual curation needed.

If no DAO-specific statement is found, consumers can fall back to the
default `statement` value.

## Real-World Context

This problem is visible in ENS's own governance. The official
[ENS delegation guide](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/managing-delegation-and-submitting-a-delegate-statement-guide/20197)
notes that statements entered via the Agora UI "are stored off-chain and
are NOT pulled from `eth.ens.delegate`" — meaning a delegate who
updates their ENS record sees no change in Agora or Tally. Platforms
have diverged from the on-chain record entirely.

The parametrized `statement` key solves this by making the ENS name the
single source of truth, with governance UIs as readers rather than stores.
