# Treasury & Contract Discovery

## The Problem

On-chain organisations and DAOs typically operate across multiple treasury addresses, governance contracts, token contracts, and protocol deployments. But there is no authoritative place where an organisation publishes the full list of addresses it controls. Tracking down this information usually involves searching through forums posts or github repositories.

This creates two problems.

The first is discoverability. If you want to understand an organisation's on-chain footprint — as a community member, auditor, integrator, or governance tool — you have to piece it together from documentation sites, GitHub READMEs, forum posts, and block explorer searches. These sources go stale, disagree with each other, and cannot be verified against the organisation's on-chain identity.

The second is security. When there is no canonical source, scam contract addresses can circulate unchallenged. Someone posts a contract address in a governance forum or group chat and claims it belongs to the organisation — and there is no on-chain record to check it against. Phishing attacks that impersonate protocol contracts succeed in part because users have no simple way to verify whether an address is genuinely claimed by the organisation it purports to belong to.

## Proposed Solution

An organisation that owns an ENS name can publish its entire on-chain footprint as subnodes — one subnode per treasury or contract — each carrying structured metadata. The organisation's ENS name becomes the authoritative, on-chain index of everything it controls.

```
supercooldao.eth
  ├── treasury.supercooldao.eth
  │     └── class        = "Treasury"
  │     └── description  = "Primary DAO treasury managed by governance"
  │
  ├── hotwallet.supercooldao.eth
  │     └── class        = "Wallet"
  │     └── description  = "Hot wallet for the DAO"
  │
  └── governance.supercooldao.eth
        └── class        = "Contract"
        └── alias        = "Governance Contract"
        └── description  = "Governance contract for the DAO"
```

Each subnode address resolves to the actual on-chain contract or wallet. The parent ENS name provides the attestation: the organisation that controls `supercooldao.eth` is the one asserting these subnodes belong to it.

## Discoverability

Because ENS records are public and indexed, an organisation's on-chain footprint is discoverable without querying any external API or documentation site:

1. Resolve the organisation's ENS name to find its subnodes.
2. For each subnode, read the `class` record to determine whether it is a `Treasury`, `Contract`, or another type.
3. Resolve the subnode's address to get the on-chain address it points to.
4. Optionally read `description` and other entries for a human-readable summary.

This gives any consumer a live, permissionless view of every address the organisation has explicitly claimed.

## Security and Accountability

Publishing contract and treasury addresses under an organisation's ENS name creates a verifiable source of truth that serves both accountability and security.

For accountability, it creates a public commitment. An organisation that lists its treasury subnodes is on record as owning those addresses. Community members can verify that funds are flowing to and from the declared addresses, and surface discrepancies if they find assets in unlisted addresses. Omission becomes visible — if an address is being used for organisational purposes but does not appear as a subnode, that is itself a signal worth investigating.

For security, it gives users something to check against. When someone shares a contract address claiming it belongs to a protocol, anyone can resolve the protocol's ENS name and verify whether that address appears as a subnode. Wallets, governance UIs, and block explorers could surface this check automatically — flagging interactions with addresses that claim to belong to an organisation but are not listed under its ENS name.
