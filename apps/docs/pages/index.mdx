# ENS Organizational Registry

A comprehensive protocol for decentralized organizational identity and metadata management built on ENS.

::::steps

### For Organizations

Establish verifiable on-chain identity with ENS domains. Store organizational metadata, manage multi-chain addresses, and delegate subdomain control to working groups — all through decentralized, governance-controlled systems.

### For Developers

Integrate organizational data seamlessly into your applications. Query rich metadata, resolve multi-chain addresses, and build governance-aware features using standardized ENS records and APIs.

### For Ecosystem

Create a unified registry of organizational identities that works across chains, tools, and platforms. Enable better discoverability, transparency, and interoperability in the decentralized ecosystem.
