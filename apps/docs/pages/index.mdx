# Node Classification Metadata

Node Classification Metadata is a proposed ENS standard (ENSIP) that allows ENS names and subnames to declare their role within a larger organizational structure. By attaching a `class` and a `schema` to any ENS node, owners can label what that node represents — such as a person, a treasury, a smart contract, or a delegate — and publish structured metadata that describes it in more detail.

This makes it possible for wallets, governance platforms, and other tools to automatically discover and interpret the purpose of an ENS name, without relying on off-chain registries or manual curation.

## Documentation overview

### [Overview](/overview)

Background on the ENSIP specification itself, how schemas work, and additional resources for following the proposal's development.

### [Schemas](/schemas)

A reference for each of the proposed schemas, organized by class. These schemas define which metadata attributes can be attached to a node of a given type, and are published to IPFS for long-term availability.

### [Use Cases](/use-cases)

Practical examples of how node classification metadata can be applied, including delegate statements for DAO governance and metadata standards for AI agents.

### [SDK](/sdk)

Developer documentation for querying ENS metadata programmatically using our TypeScript SDK.
