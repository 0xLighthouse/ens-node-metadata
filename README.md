# ENS: Node Classification Metadata

This is a monorepo for the Node Classification Metadata project, sponsored by ENS. An ENSIP is [currently in development](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensips/pull/64) to standardize a protocol for adding additional metadata attributes to ENS names. This will make it possible to attach structured, typed records (like organizational roles, categories, or labels) directly to ENS nodes onchain. This repo includes a proof-of-concept interface for reading and writing those records, along with the supporting SDK, schemas, and documentation.

For additional background on the project, see [our Notion page](https://stealth-respect-4e8.notion.site/Organizational-Metadata-on-ENS-2313a8375c77801dad2ce5b513ce9450).

## Development

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) for orchestrating builds across the monorepo and [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) for dependency management.

Code quality is enforced automatically:

- **Formatting & linting** are handled by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/).
- **Commit messages** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), enforced by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) and [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) git hooks.
